# LinuxFilePermissionsProjec
In Linux, file permissions control access to files and directories. Permissions (read, write, execute) are assigned to three user types: owner, group, and others. Modify permissions with the `chmod` command. Include special permissions (Setuid, Setgid, Sticky Bit), manage ownership (`chown`, `chgrp`), and use ACLs for granular control.
